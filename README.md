Flaming Python eaten by a Bird
==============================

Firebird is a nice file based database. 
It's open source and sports concurrency (unlike it's SQLite counterpart).
Never the less it's horrible in combination with Python. Finding a functioning lib that injects queries and actually gets something back is horribly hard.  
Thus: this is how you do it. Never the less it feels like your Python is on fire while being eaten by this bird.
